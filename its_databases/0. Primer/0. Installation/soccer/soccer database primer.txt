In SQL Server Express, create a database called Soccer.
	create database Soccer;

In the database, create a table called Clubs.
The table should have the following fields and data types:
• club_name varchar(20)
• stadium_name varchar(20)
• ground_capacity int
• club_manager varchar(30)
• year_founded date
	create table Clubs
	(
		club_name varchar(20),
		stadium_name varchar(20),
		ground_capacity int,
		club_manager varchar(30),
		year_founded date
	);

Insert the following records into the table.
Club Name Stadium Name Ground Capacity Club Manager Year Founded
Manchester Utd Old Trafford 74140 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 1878-01-01
Liverpool FC Anfield 53394 Jurgen Klopp 1892-06-03
	insert into Clubs
	(club_name, stadium_name, ground_capacity, club_manager, year_founded)
	values
	('Manchester Utd', 'Old Trafford', 74140, 'Ole Gunnar Solskjaer', '1878-01-01'),
	('Liverpool FC', 'Anfield', 53394, 'Jurgen Klopp', '1892-06-03');

• Update the record for ‘Liverpool FC’ so that the ground capacity is now 75000.
	update clubs
	set ground_capacity = 75000
	where club_name = 'Liverpool FC';

• Update the value stored for the Club Manager of Manchester Utd to ‘Mike Phelan’.
	update clubs
	set club_manager = 'Mike Phelan'
	where club_name = 'Manchester Utd';

• Write a query that lists all records stored in the table.
	select * from clubs;

• Delete the record for ‘Manchester Utd’ from the table.
	-- delete from clubs where club_name = 'Manchester Utd';
	select * from Clubs;
