# gamescollection

I decided to create this repository to display my relational database consisting of my PlayStation
video game collection.  

I plan to create the database with MySQL and MongoDB, using data I gathered and compiled from Google Sheets.  

I have set up a local database in Microsoft Visual Studio, then allocated the data into various tables
in SQL, planning on setting up the database for remote access ASAP:

# 1: Dates & Times:  
*	How many video games were purchased in a selected year/month/date/day?  
*	What year/month/date/day saw the most purchases?  
*	Graphs will display annual spending from 2009 to present year, using FullPrice, SalePrice & Savings,
	illustrating spending in a line chart to see how spending fluctuates each year.  

# 2: Finances & Savings:  
*	How much did all of the video games cost since starting my collection back in 2009?  
*	How much money was saved on video games via sales, gifts and PlayStation's online subscription service?  
*	How does the cost of PlayStation's online subscription service compare to the FullPrice of games
	redeemed, how much was saved using the service?  
*	Graphs will display total savings from 2009 to present year, using FullPrice, SalePrice & Savings,
	illustrating savings as a percentage.  

# 3: Origins, Developers & Countries:  
*	How many distinct game developers are in the collection, who is my favourite?  
*	Which developer & country have contributed the largest amount of video games in the collection?
*	What are the Top 10 countries worldwide for developing video games?  
*	Graph will display the ranking of countries involved in video gaming development in a bar chart.
