PlayStation Games Collection

I decided to create this repository to display my relational database consisting of my PlayStation video game collection.
I have sourced various information from various sources to assist in answering questions:

#1: Dates and Times; how many video games were purchased in a selected year/month/date/day?

#2: Developers and Countries; how many distinct developers and countries are in the collection, which developer and country have contributed the largest amount of video games in my collection?

#3: Finances, Savings & Compatibility; how much did all of the video games cost since starting my collection in 2009, how much money was saved on video games via sales and gifts, how many different consoles are in the collection, how many video games per console, how many video games are compatible with multiple consoles?

#4: Genres & Themes; how many distinct video game genres & themes are in the collection, which genre and theme has the most video games attributed to them in the collection?

I plan to create the database through MySQL and MongoDB, using data from Google Sheets.
I have moved data from Google Sheets to VSCode and split data into 4 CSV files to integrate into SQL:
#1: Dates and Times
#2: Developers and Countries
#3: Finances, Savings & Compatibility
#4: Genres & Themes

Credit to PSNProfiles, they are an independent group who compile the gaming play history & progress of PlayStation gamers upon signing up for free (I contributed a one-off payment to PSNProfiles to unlock the Premium version of the website).
