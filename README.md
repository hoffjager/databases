# gamescollection

I decided to create this repository to display my relational database consisting of my PlayStation & Nintendo video game collections.  
I plan to create the databases with T-SQL and MongoDB, using data I gathered and compiled from Google Sheets.  
I have set up local databases in Microsoft Visual Studio, then allocated the data into various tables in T-SQL & MongoDB, planning on setting up the databases
for remote access soon:
