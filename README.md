# gamescollection  

Updated as of 30th September 2025

Introduction  
I decided to create this repository to display my relational databases, consisting of both my PlayStation & Nintendo video game collections.  
I have earned a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics from ATU Galway, along with the IT Specialist Certificate in Databases from Pearson Vue.  
I thought of my video game collections as the perfect example of implementing my learnings from the above courses.  
I have set up local T-SQL databases via Microsoft SQL Server 2014, and I am planning on implementing the databases on a website for remote access soon.  
  
Data compilation and analysis were carried out to discover insights in relation to various matters, such as pricing & purchases of games per year or per month:  
Video game receipts issued to my Gmail account at times of purchase  
Raw data temporarily entered & compiled in Google Sheets files over a number of years, to be added to the database via Microsoft SQL Server 2014

All video games in the t10hours XLSX tab are sorted by hours played in descending order:  
In the event that games are equal in hours played, they are sorted by value for money:  
Value for money is a metric that consists of the paid price divided by the hours played, to yield the cost per hour played.  
The games with lower/better values are higher in the rankings (ascending order).  
This confirms that they are better value for money, in comparison to other games with an equal number of hours played.  
In the event that games are also equal in value for money, they are then sorted by savings in descending order:  
This will result in the games with the highest savings, to be listed as a higher priority in the rankings.
