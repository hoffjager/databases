PlayStation Games Collection

I decided to create this repository to house my database of my PlayStation video game collection.
I have sourced various information from various sources to assist in answering questions:
#1: Console; how many different consoles are in the collection, and how many video games per console?
#2: Cost & Savings; how much did all the video games cost, how much money was saved via sales and gifts, how many video games were purchased in a selected year/month/date/day?
#3: Geography; how many distinct countries are in the collection, which country developed the most video games, how many distinct developers are in the collection, which developer has developed the most video games?
#4: Genre; how many distinct video game genres are in the collection, which genre has the most video games attributed to it in the collection?
#5: Play Time; when were selected video games most recently played in the collection, how many hours were played per video game in the collection?

I plan to create the database through MySQL and MongoDB, using data from Google Sheets.
